To securely store passwords, we used Spring Boots Bcrypt library to hash the passwords before they were stored in the database. This way, if the database contents are leaked the passwords won't be stored in plaintext. Whenever the user attempts to login, the database retrieves the row matching the entered username and compares the entered password to the password hash stored in the database using the Bcrypt library. If the two match the login attempt is successful.
